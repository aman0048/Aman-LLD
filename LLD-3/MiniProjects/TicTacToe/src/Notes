First we created GameController class and added all the necessary methods, we will use as part of playing the game

Checking a winner, making a move, Replay the game, Undo things, Create/Start a game
Also, what all classes we used in GameController, added them in the model package like
Board, Game, GameStatus, Move,

Will start with Game class, as its the heavy class and it will follow the builder design pattern
After this we will focus on creating the Board class, as we need to have a board, for playing the game
So, need to initialize and create an empty board

Player has one imp task, which is to make an entry on the board


Flow (Day 1)
Build game class with builder design pattern. To build the game we need the board class, So, build the board
Board has two things, once is initialization of the board and display board and for building the board, we need
the cell class. In cell the cell constructor and the display cell and everything is a support class.
