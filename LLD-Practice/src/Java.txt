A regular class can inherit only one class, but it can inherit multiple interfaces.
If we create an abstract class, it is still a class, therefore, if a regular class wants to inherit it,
it can only inherit one class.
Abstract classes are used when we want to add attributes + Methods.
Interface are used when we only want method.
